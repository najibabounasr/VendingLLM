# VendingLLM
Comparing the performance of LLMs, ML-based scripts, and hybrid models for autonomous vending machine management—covering restocking, repair requests, pricing, and product selection—to evaluate LLMs in decentralized, real-world decision-making.

# Product Decsription
This research project explores the comparative effectiveness of three approaches in managing complex, unsupervised, and fully automated tasks:

## 1. A Large Language Model (LLM)

## 2. A machine learning pipeline built on statistical models

## 3. A hybrid system where an LLM leverages ML predictions

The case study focuses on *autonomous vending machine management*, covering end-to-end operations such as restocking decisions, order placement, repair requests, pricing strategy, and product selection driven by real sales data.

The experiment aims to evaluate whether LLMs can perform effectively in *real-world decentralized systems*, benchmark them against specialized ML scripts, and investigate how hybrid architectures may represent the future of automated decision-making in distributed environments.

# Motivations

Novelty: Most research isolates either LLMs or classical ML pipelines. You’re directly comparing LLMs, statistical ML, and a hybrid in the same real-world task — vending machine management. That’s a rare and interesting benchmark.

Practicality: It’s not just a toy problem; vending machines combine logistics (restocking), finance (pricing), operations (repairs), and customer behavior (product choice). That makes it a surprisingly rich testbed for automation.

Future relevance: The core question — can LLMs function in decentralized, automated decision systems — is very timely. It touches on the future of autonomous agents, IoT, and distributed AI systems.
